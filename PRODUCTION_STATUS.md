   - **Trial** (7 days, all features)
   - **Basic** ($29/year) - Single device, OpenAI API only
   - **Pro** ($49/year) - 3 devices, includes local models
5. Enable Stripe integration
6. Get your Keygen API key and Account ID
7. Create a public verification key

#### Once You Have Keygen Credentials:

**I will implement:**

1. **License Validation Module** (`src/licensing.rs`)

   - Keygen API integration
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Online/offline validation
   - Grace period handling

2. **Trial Mode**

   - 7-day full-feature trial
   - Trial countdown display
   - Conversion prompts

3. **License UI Enhancements**

sha2 = "0.10"
hex = "0.4"
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
```
