## ⚠️ Known Limitations (v0.2.0)

### **Critical (Must Address Before Scale):**

1. **No Code Signing**

   - Windows shows "Unknown Publisher" warning
   - Users must click "More info" → "Run anyway"
   - **Impact:** Reduces trust, increases support burden
   - **Solution:** Purchase code signing certificate (~$75-400/year)
   - **Priority:** HIGH

2. **FFmpeg Not Bundled**
   - Users must install FFmpeg separately
   - Common point of friction
   - **Impact:** Worse first-time experience
   - **Solution:** Bundle ffmpeg.exe with installer
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

### **Important (Address Soon):**

3. **No Auto-Update**

   - Users must manually download updates
   - **Impact:** Users on old versions with bugs
   - **Solution:** Implement Tauri updater
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

4. **Windows Only**
   - No macOS or Linux support
   - **Impact:** Smaller addressable market
   - **Solution:** Build for other platforms
   - **Priority:** LOW (validate Windows first)

### **Nice to Have:**

5. **Single Platform**

   - Only x64 architecture
   - No ARM64 support (Surface, newer laptops)
   - **Priority:** LOW

6. **Large Initial Model Download**
   - Local models are 75 MB - 1.5 GB
   - **Impact:** Slow first use
   - **Solution:** Bundle base model
   - **Priority:** LOW

---

## 💰 Cost to Fix Limitations

### **Immediate Costs:**

1. **Code Signing Certificate**

   - **Cost:** $75-400/year
   - **Options:**
     - Sectigo/Comodo: ~$75/year
     - DigiCert: ~$400/year (better reputation)
   - **ROI:** Significantly improves trust

2. **FFmpeg Bundling**
   - **Cost:** Free (just development time)
   - **Time:** ~2-3 hours
   - **ROI:** Better UX, fewer support tickets

### **Future Costs:**

3. **macOS Code Signing**

   - **Cost:** $99/year (Apple Developer account)
   - **Priority:** After Windows validated

4. **Auto-Update Infrastructure**
   - **Cost:** ~$5-20/month (hosting)
   - **Or:** Use GitHub Releases (free)

## 📝 Notes from Build Process

### **What Went Smoothly:**

- ✅ Tauri bundler "just worked" after minor config
- ✅ NSIS installer is professional-looking
- ✅ Build process is fast (~30 seconds)
- ✅ Installer size is reasonable (4.3 MB)
- ✅ Documentation was straightforward to create

### **What Was Tricky:**

- ⚠️ NSIS language file path issue (fixed: use "English" not "en-US")
- ⚠️ Icon paths need to be specified explicitly
- ⚠️ Bundle identifier naming (avoid `.app` suffix)

### **What to Remember:**

- 💡 Test on clean machines EARLY
- 💡 Code signing should be priority #1
- 💡 FFmpeg bundling will save lots of support time
- 💡 User guide is critical for adoption

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Installer is just the beginning** - Distribution is 50% of the work
2. **Documentation matters** - Users need clear guidance
3. **Trust signals are critical** - Code signing, website quality
4. **Testing on clean machines is essential** - Dev environments hide issues
5. **End-to-end testing is required** - Payment → Email → Activation flow
